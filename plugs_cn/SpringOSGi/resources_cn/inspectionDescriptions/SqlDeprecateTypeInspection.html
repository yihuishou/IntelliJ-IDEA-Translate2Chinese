  Since 8.0 the 'long' type is deprecated and not recommended to use (because API for this type doesn't utilize character streams but transfer whole values each time).
  In Oracle, do not create a table with LONG columns. Use LOB columns (CLOB, NCLOB, BLOB) instead. LONG columns are supported only for backward compatibility.
